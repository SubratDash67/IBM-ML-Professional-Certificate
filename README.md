## üéØ Key Projects

### Movie Recommendation System (Capstone)
A comprehensive movie recommendation system implementing multiple approaches:
- **Content-Based Filtering** using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- **Collaborative Filtering** with K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Matrix Factorization** using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- **Deep Learning** approach with neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras
- **Clustering-Based** recommendations using K-Means

**Performance Results:**
- Neural Network: RMSE=0.944, MAE=0.725 (Best performing)
- NMF: RMSE=3.534, MAE=3.359

### Classification Projects
- Iris species classification using various ML algorithms
- Country development analysis and clustering
